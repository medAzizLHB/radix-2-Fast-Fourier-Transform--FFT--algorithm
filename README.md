# radix-2 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm
This code implements a simple radix-2 FFT algorithm.
The input data is stored in the data_in signal and the output data is stored in the data_out signal.
The stage1 and stage2 signals store intermediate values during the FFT calculation. 
The index signal is used to keep track of the index for the input data. 
The twiddle_factor signal is not used in this code, but it can be added to implement more advanced FFT algorithms.

Note: This code is a basic example and may not meet the requirements for all FFT applications.
